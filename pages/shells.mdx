title: Shells
---

A shell is an command language interpreter that executes commands from
standard input devices (like a keyboard) or from a file. Shells are not
a part of the system kernel, but use the system kernel to execute
programs, create files, etc.

Use `chsh` from `termux-tools` to change your login shell. Currently
Termux supports bash, fish, zsh and a few other shells.

## Bash

Bash (**B**ourne-**A**gain **SH**ell) is the default shell of Termux.  
The Bssh shell init files are `~/.bashrc`, `$PREFIX/etc/bash.bashrc` and
more. See `man bash` and `info bash` for more information.

## Beanshell

Beanshell is a fully Java compatible scripting language. BeanShell is
now capable of interpreting ordinary Java source and loading .java
source files from the class path. BeanShell scripted classes are fully
typed and appear to outside Java code and via reflective inspection as
ordinary classes. However their implementation is fully dynamic and they
may include arbitrary BeanShell scripts in their bodies, methods, and
constructors. Users may now freely mix loose, unstructured BeanShell
scripts, method closures, and full scripted classes.

Fish (**F**riendly **I**nteractive **SH**ell) is a smart and user-friendly
command line shell for macOS, Linux, and the rest of the \*NIX family.  
The Fish shell init files are `~/.fish`, `$PREFIX/etc/fish/config.fish`
and more. See `man fish` and `info fish` for more information.

Korn Shell programming language, forked from OpenBSD pdksh.

more. See `man zsh` and `info zsh` for more information.
